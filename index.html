            <p class="SectionSubTag text-small paras-text-small">Spider-Man is a superhero appearing 
                in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee 
                and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 
                (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has since been featured in movies, 
                television shows, video games, and plays. Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, an 
                orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard 
                and Mary Parker died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles 
                of adolescence and financial issues and gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash 
                Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson and Harry Osborn, romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson 
                and the Black Cat, and foes such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin and Venom. In his origin 
                story, he gets spider-related abilities from a bite from a radioactive spider; these include 
                clinging to surfaces, superhuman strength and agility, and detecting danger with his 
                "spider-sense.</p>

            <p class="SectionSubTag text-small paras-text-small">In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic 
                Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was casting about for a new superhero 
                idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books, 
                and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify.As with Fantastic 
                Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to "get out of his system" what he felt was missing 
                in comic books.In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime 
                fighter the Spider as a great influence,and in a multitude of print and video 
                interviews, Lee stated he was further inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wall

            <p class="SectionSubTag text-small paras-text-small">A few months after Spider-Man's 
                introduction, publisher Goodman reviewed the sales figures for that issue and was shocked 
                to find it was one of the nascent Marvel's highest-selling comics.A solo ongoing 
                series followed, beginning with The Amazing Spider-Man #1 (cover-dated March 1963). The title 
                eventually became Marvel's top-selling series with the character swiftly becoming a 
                cultural icon; a 1965 Esquire poll of college campuses found that college students ranked 
                Spider-Man and fellow Marvel hero the Hulk alongside Bob Dylan and Che Guevara as their 
                favorite revolutionary icons. One interviewee selected Spider-Man because he was "beset by 
                woes, money problems, and the question of existence. In short, he is one of us.</p>
